							"So, what is vnds?" That's probably what some- no, most of you are probably asking. Well, vnds is a homebrew program for the Nintendo DS and Android, created by Jake Probst in 2008. As you can probably guess, its sole purpose is to let you play popular visual novels easily on the go. It's... Outdated now, to say the least, and it hasn't been updated in ages. But there's just something about it that strikes me, and it's honestly a really neat time capsule. It also stikes me in the aspect that it has some lost media, which is another personal interest of mine. So, what this page aims to do is basically go in depth as possible when it comes to vnds and it's related content. So, with that said, either filter though the table of contents or just scroll down to learn more about this weird bit of software.
